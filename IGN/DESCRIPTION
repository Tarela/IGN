Description: IGN is performed by normalizing the promoter chromatin accessibility signals for a given gene set that is unchanged in expression, usually obtained from accompanying RNA-seq data, and extrapolating to scale the genome-wide chromatin accessibility profile. This function allows users to normalize ATAC/DNase-seq signal matrix based on promoter signal of invariable genes.
